To ensure students have a standard platform for data analysis, we suggest using conda from [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create a virtual environment, where you can install python and required (python) packages.
It is also a good working practice to have your own python environments on laptops/remote servers.

## Installing miniconda

Download and install the package from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
Locate the installed miniconda3, e.g. "/Users/**your_username**/opt/miniconda3/" on MacOS, then activate it:

    source your_path_to_miniconda3/bin/activate

Then when you issue the following commands, you should see the corresponding outputs.

    which conda
/Users/**your_username**/opt/miniconda3/bin/conda

    which python
/Users/**your_username**/opt/miniconda3/bin/python

Although there is already python installed inside miniconda3, we will create a new python environment for this exercise. [Why using python virtual environment?](https://www.google.com/search?q=should+i+use+python+virtual+environment&oq=Why+shall+I+use+python+virtual+en&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i22i30.10271j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


## Create a virtual environment using conda

After you activated conda with

    source your_path_to_miniconda3/bin/activate

Create a virtual Environment named "training" and activate it:

    conda create --name training
    conda activate training

## Install python and python packages

Inatall python in the virtual Environment "training". (It is recommended to use 'conda-forge' channel to ensure consistency across packages.)

    conda install -c conda-forge python=3.10.0

As conda is slow, [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is created to install packages much faster.

    conda install -c conda-forge mamba

Then install all required packages in this exercise:

    mamba install -c conda-forge numpy
    mamba install -c conda-forge matplotlib
    mamba install -c conda-forge cartopy
    mamba install -c conda-forge netcdf4
    mamba install -c conda-forge jupyter
    mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
