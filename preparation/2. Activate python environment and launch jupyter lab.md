## Activate python environment

Locate the installed miniconda3, e.g. "/Users/**your_username**/opt/miniconda3/" on MacOS, then activate it:

    source your_path_to_miniconda3/bin/activate

Activate the virtual Environment "training":

    conda activate training

To use python, you have many options (only two are listed):

Activate it directly in terminal/console:

    python

And exit with

    exit()

In our exercise, we will use jypyter lab session for better presentation. Launch a jypyter lab session in the folder 'finse_school': (Note the dot following 'jupyter lab' means current directory and is necessary.)

    cd your_path_to_finse_school

    jupyter lab .
